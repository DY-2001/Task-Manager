1. Adding and Editing Stages:

Tables: I will add a new table called Stages to store information about the different stages that users can create and edit for a particular board. This table will include fields like stage_id, board_id, stage_name, and position to maintain the order of stages within a board.

API Endpoints: I will add API endpoints to support creating, editing, and deleting stages for a board. These endpoints will include:

POST /api/boards/:board_id/stages: To create a new stage for a specific board.
PUT /api/stages/:stage_id: To edit the properties of an existing stage.
DELETE /api/stages/:stage_id: To delete a stage from a board.
2. Adding Comments to Tasks:

Tables: I will create a Comments table to store comments associated with tasks. This table will have fields such as comment_id, task_id, user_id, content, and timestamp to track who made the comment and when.

API Endpoints: I will add API endpoints to manage task comments, such as:

POST /api/tasks/:task_id/comments: To add a comment to a specific task.
GET /api/tasks/:task_id/comments: To retrieve comments for a task.
PUT /api/comments/:comment_id: To edit a comment.
DELETE /api/comments/:comment_id: To delete a comment.
3. Error Handling:

To handle errors effectively in my application, I will implement the following strategies:

Error Responses: I will ensure that my API endpoints return clear and informative error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).

Error Messages: I will include descriptive error messages in the response body to help developers and users understand the issue. I will use consistent error formats, such as JSON, for error responses.
